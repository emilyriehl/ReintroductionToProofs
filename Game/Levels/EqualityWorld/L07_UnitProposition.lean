Title "Unit Proposition"

Introduction "Lean has a built in unit type `Unit` that contains just one element denoted `() : Unit`.

The unit type is a proposition, meaning that it has at most one element.

More precisely, if `x y : Unit` are elements of the unit type, then we can prove `x = y` by a definitional equality, aka, by reflexivity.
"

Conclusion "In the next level, we will prove that the empty type is also a proposition."
