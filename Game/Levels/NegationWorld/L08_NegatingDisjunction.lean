Level 8

Title "Negating Disjunction"

Introduction "In this level, we will study the proposition `¬ (P ∨ Q)`.

How would we disprove the implication `P ∨ Q`?

What does it mean for `P ∨ Q` to be false?

Recall, if `P` is true, then we can prove `P ∨ Q`. Similarly, if `Q` is true, we can prove `P ∨ Q`.

So if `P ∨ Q` is false, then both `P` and `Q` must be false.

In this level, we will show that `¬ (P ∨ Q)` is logically equivalent to `¬ P ∧ ¬ Q`.

If you have forgotten the meaning of logical equivalence, denoted `↔`, you can look it up in the library.
"
