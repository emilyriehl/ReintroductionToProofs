Title "Universal Property"

Introduction "
What must be true in order to have `P ∨ Q → R`?

On the one hand, if `P ∨ Q → R` is true, then `P → R` is true, because `P` implies `P ∨ Q`, which implies `R`.

Similar reasoning shows that if `P ∨ Q → R` is true, then `Q → R` is true.

Conversely, if *either* `P → R` or `Q → R` are true, this does not necessarily imply that `P ∨ Q → R` is true. Can you see why?

However, if *both* `P → R` and `Q → R` are true, then `P ∨ Q → R` is true.

The aim of this level is to establish a logical equivalence between `P ∨ Q → R` and `(P → R) ∧ (Q → R)`."

Conclusion "This logical equivalence captures the *universal property* of disjunction, explaining how the mathematical or is used in a proof."
