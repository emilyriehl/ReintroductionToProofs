Title "Introducing Or"

Introduction "To prove a disjunction `P ∨ Q` it suffices to supply a proof of either `P` or of `Q`.

Thus under the hypothesis that `P` and `Q` are both true, there are two ways to prove `P ∨ Q`: one using `p : P` and one using `q : Q`.

Note `exact p` or `exact q` won't work as these are proofs of different propositions.
"

/--
For propositions `P` and `Q`, the `left` tactic converts a goal of `P ∨ Q` to a goal of `P`. For types `A` and `B`, the `left` tactic converts a goal of `A ⊕ B` into a goal of `A`.

/--
For propositions `P` and `Q`, the `right` tactic converts a goal of `P ∨ Q` to a goal of `Q`. For types `A` and `B`, the `right` tactic converts a goal of `A ⊕ B` into a goal of `B`.

  Hint "You have two choices: to reduce to the case of proving the left proposition or to reduce to the case of proving the right proposition. Type `left` to tell Lean you'd like to prove the left proposition or type `right` to tell Lean you'd like to prove the right proposition."

Conclusion "If this is your first time solving this level, delete your code and prove the same theorem another way. You can also use the proofs of the implications `Or.inl : P → P ∨ Q` and `Or.inr : Q → P ∨ Q` that are now in the library."
