Title "And Implies Or"

Introduction "The proposition `P ∧ Q` is *stronger* than the proposition `P ∨ Q` because `P ∧ Q → P ∨ Q` is true in general, but the implication `P ∨ Q → P ∧ Q` does not necessarily hold.

Note the implication `P ∧ Q → P ∨ Q` holds because the mathematical *or* is &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo;, meaning that if `P` and `Q` are both true, then `P ∨ Q` is true, and in fact can be proven in two different ways."
