Introduction
"In Negation World, we proved various tautologies involving negation such as

* `P → ¬ ¬ P`
* `(P → Q) → (¬ Q → ¬ P)`
* `¬ P ∨ ¬ Q → ¬ (P ∧ Q)`
* `(P ∧ ¬ Q) → ¬ (P → Q)`

for arbitrary propositions `P` and `Q`.

But we were not able to prove the converses of any of these implications. Why not?

The reason is that all of the proofs we have given thusfar involve explicit constructive arguments. For example, whenever we proved that a disjunction `P ∨ Q` held under certain hypotheses, our proof gave the information of *which* of the propositions `P` and `Q` is true.

One way to identify a constructive proof of implication is to think about whether there is a corresponding function between types. For arbitrary types `A` and `B` it is possible to define functions of type

* `A → (A → Empty) → Empty`
* `(A → B) → (B → Empty) → (A → Empty)`
* `(A → Empty) ⊕ (B → Empty) → (A × B → Empty)`
* `A × (B → Empty) → (A → B) → Empty`

using analogous constructions to the proofs of the constructive implications.

In this world, we study *classical mathematics*, which assumes two additional axioms, each of which permits new proof techniques.

The first axiom, called the *law of excluded middle*, asserts that for any proposition `P`, `P ∨ ¬ P` is true.

This permits the strategy of proof by cases. Under the assumption that `P ∨ ¬ P` is true, you can split the argument into two cases, one assuming `P` is true and the other assuming `P` is false.

The other axiom, called *double negation elimination*, asserts that for any proposition `P`, `¬ ¬ P → P` is true.

This permits a proof strategy called *proof by contradiction*. If the goal is to prove `P` we can use the assumption `¬ ¬ P → P` to reason as follows:

* First assume that `P` is false, so `¬ P` is true.
* Then use the assumption `¬ P` to derive a contradiction, thus constructing a proof of `¬ ¬ P`.
* Finally, apply the implication `¬ ¬ P → P` to convert the proof of `¬ ¬ P` into a proof of `P`.

In fact, as statements concerning arbitrary propositions, the law of exluded middle and double negation elimination are equivalent &mdash; even constructively &mdash; as we will show in the Boss Level of this world.
