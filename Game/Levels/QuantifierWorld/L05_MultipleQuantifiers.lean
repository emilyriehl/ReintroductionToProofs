Title "Multiple Quantifiers"

Introduction "Any type `A` has a family of propositions `A → A → Prop` given by the equality types.

For `x y : A`, we have the proposition `x = y`.

Using the universal and existential quantifiers we can form eight different propositions:

* We can choose either `∀ x` or `∃ x`.
* We can choose either `∀ y` or `∃ y`.
* We can put the quantifier involving `x` before or after the quantifier involving `y`.

When we have two existential quantifiers or two universal quantifiers, the order doesn't matter, so we have logical equivalences

`∀ x, ∀ y, x = y ↔ ∀ y, ∀ x, x = y`
`∃ x, ∃ y, x = y ↔ ∃ x, ∃ y, x = y`

In this case, since `x = y ↔ y = x`, we have further logical equivalences
`∀ x, ∃ y, x = y ↔ ∀ y, ∃ x, x = y`
`∃ x, ∀ y, x = y ↔ ∃ y, ∀ x, x = y`

The four statements
`∀ x : A, ∀ y : A, x = y`
`∀ x : A, ∃ y : A, x = y`
`∃ x : A, ∀ y : A, x = y`
`∃ x : A, ∃ y : A, x = y`
have very different meanings.

The statement `∃ x : A, ∃ y : A, x = y` asserts that the type is *inhabited* meaning has an element `a : A`.
Whenever such an element exists, this statement is true, but for the empty type, this statement is false.

The statement `∀ x : A, ∀ y : A, x = y` asserts that the type is a *proposition*. When `A` is empty this is true (as there is nothing to prove). When `A` is a true proposition, it is also true, because any two proofs `x y : A` are equal.

The statement `∃ x : A, ∀ y : A, x = y` asserts that the type is a true proposition, or equivalently, that the type `A` is *contractible*. When `A` is empty, this statement is false, but when `A` is a true proposition, it has some proof `x : A` and any other proof `y : A` is equal to `x`.

The final statement `∀ x : A, ∃ y : A, x = y` is just true for any type. Your objective in this level is to prove this.

Conclusion "In the next level, we will explore the consequences of exchanging the order of universal and existential quantifiers."

/--
For goals of the form `∃ (x : A), P x` the tactic `use` can be used to provide an element `a : A` which will satisfy `P a`. For multiple constructors like `∃ (x y : A), P x y`, you can provide comma-separated values: `use a, a'`.

Note that the version of the `use` tactic for this game is somewhat weaker than the real one in Mathlib, which automatically tries to solve the remaining goal.-/
