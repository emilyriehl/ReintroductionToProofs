Title "Swapping inputs"

Introduction "Recall that an element of type `A → B → C` can be thought of as a function of two variables.

Given `f : A → B → C`, `a : A`, and `b : B`, `f a b : C` denotes `f` applied first to `a` and then to `b`.

From a function of type `A → B → C`, we can define a function of type `B → A → C` by swapping the order of the variables that are input into the function.

  Hint (hidden := true) "When in doubt, start defining a function by using the tactic `intro` followed by your preferred variable name."

  intro a
  Hint (hidden := true) "Look carefully at the order of the arguments of `{f}`."
  exact f a b

Conclusion "Note that for a particular multvariable function `f : A → B → C`, its type dictates that the variable of type `A` must be supplied before the variable of type `B`. But as observed in this level, we can then define a corresponding function `swap f : B → A → C` which encodes the same information."
