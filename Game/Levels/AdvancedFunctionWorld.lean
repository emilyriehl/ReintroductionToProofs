World "AdvancedFunctionWorld"
Title "Advanced Function World"

Introduction "In this world, we will return to our study of functions.

Using the universal and existential quantifiers, we will state important properties of functions
and prove the interrelationships between these notions.

We will also answer the question of what it means for two functions `f g : A â†’ B` to be equal.

These results will be used in Equivalence World to answer what it means for two types to be the same.
