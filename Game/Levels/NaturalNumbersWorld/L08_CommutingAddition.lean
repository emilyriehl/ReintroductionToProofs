Title "Commuting Addition"

Introduction "
Using the theorems we have proven so far, we can now prove a serious theorem about the natural numbers, namely the commutativity of addition.

That is, we will show that for all natural numbers `m` and `n`, `m + n = n + m`.

This can be proven by induction on either variable, though you may find one variable easier than the other.

Good luck!

Conclusion "This proves the theorem `Nat.add_comm : ∀ m n : ℕ, m + n = n + m`, which is now in your library."

/--
For `m n : Nat`, `Nat.add_comm m n` is the proof that `m + n = n + m`.
