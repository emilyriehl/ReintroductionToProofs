Title "Invertible Implies Bijective"

Introduction "Suppose `f : A → B` is an invertible function, with an inverse function `g : B → A`.

Then it follows that `f` is bijective, both injective and surjective.

Your objective this level is to prove this.

Conclusion "In the proof that `f` is injective, you used only one half of the invertibility condition. Can you use this observation to state a theorem that proves that `f` is injective under a weaker hypothesis? Similarly, in the proof that `f` is surjective, you used only the other half of the invertiblility condition. Can you use this observation to state a theorem that proves that `f` is surjective under a weaker hypothesis?"
