Title "Boss Level"

Introduction "Using function extensionality, we can give a third logically equivalence characterization of what it means for a function `f : A → B` to be bijective or invertible.

A function `f : A → B` is an *isomorphism* if there exists a function `g : B → A` so that `g ∘ f = id` and `f ∘ g = id`.

The first equation is between functions from `A` to `A`. By function extensionality, it is equivalent to the condition that `∀ a : A, g (f a)`.

The second equation is between functions from `B` to `B`. By function extensionality, it is equivalent to the condition that `∀ b : B, f (g a)`.

In Lean, isomorphisms of types are also called *equivalences*, perhaps acknowledging a newly discovered connection between dependent type theory and homotopy theory.

For the Boss Level, prove the logical equivalence between the conditions that whether `f` is invertible or whether `f` is an isomorphism.

Conclusion "Using our newly understood notion of bijective function, or invertible function, or isomorphism, we can now study what it means for a pair of types to be *equivalent*. Move on to Equivalence World next."
