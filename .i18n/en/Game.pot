"* a function §18\n"
"* a proof §19\n"

"\n"
"The first two pieces of data resemble the data required by a logical equivalence §21. For that one needs proofs §22 and §23 of the implications in each direction.\n"
"\n"
"The remaining data is relevant because functions carry more information than implications. In particular, there may be multiple functions from §24 to §25 and from §26 to §27.\n"
"\n"
"By function extensionality, the proof §28 witnesses the fact that §29 while the proof §30 witnesses the fact that §31. Together this tells us that the functions §32 and §33 are *inverses*.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, if §34 and §35 are thought of as operations that exchange elements of types §36 and §37, both operations can be undone.\n"
